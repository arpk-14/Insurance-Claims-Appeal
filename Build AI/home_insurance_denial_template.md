Re: Appeal of Home Insurance Claim Denial
Policy Number: [Policy Number]
Claim Number: [Claim Number]
Date of Loss: [Date of Incident]
Property Address: [Property Address]

Dear Claims Review Department:

I am writing to appeal your decision to deny my home insurance claim for damage that occurred on [date of incident]. According to your denial letter dated [denial date], the claim was denied because [specific reason from denial letter]. After reviewing my policy and the circumstances of the damage, I believe this determination was made in error, and I am requesting a full review of this decision.

## Incident Details and Coverage

The damage to my property occurred on [date] due to [cause of damage, e.g., storm, fire, water leak]. My home at [property address] is covered under policy number [policy number], which has been in effect since [policy start date]. The damage includes [brief description of damage], with an estimated repair cost of [estimated amount].

At the time of the incident:
1. My policy was in full force with premiums paid through [date]
2. The property was maintained in accordance with all policy requirements
3. The damage sustained is specifically covered under the [relevant coverage section] of my policy
4. I promptly reported the damage to your company on [date reported]

## Response to Specific Denial Reason

Your denial letter stated that coverage was denied because [quote specific reason]. This determination appears to be incorrect for the following reasons:

[Choose the appropriate section based on denial reason]

### For Maintenance/Wear and Tear Denial:
The damage to my property was not the result of normal wear and tear or lack of maintenance. Rather, it was caused by a sudden and accidental [type of incident], which is a covered peril under my policy. I have maintained my property in good condition, as evidenced by [reference maintenance records, inspections, etc.]. The damage occurred despite proper maintenance, not because of neglect.

### For Excluded Peril Denial:
While I understand that [excluded peril] is generally not covered, the actual cause of damage was [covered peril], which is specifically covered under section [policy section] of my policy. The evidence supporting this includes [describe evidence that shows covered peril was the cause]. The [expert assessment/contractor report] from [name] confirms that the damage resulted from [covered peril], not [excluded peril].

### For Policy Exclusion Denial:
I acknowledge that my policy contains certain exclusions, but I believe this exclusion has been misapplied in my case. Section [policy section] states [quote relevant policy language]. This exclusion does not apply to my claim because [explanation of why exclusion doesn't apply]. Additionally, section [policy section] provides coverage for [relevant coverage], which applies to my situation.

### For Insufficient Documentation Denial:
I have now gathered comprehensive documentation to support my claim, including [list additional documentation provided]. These documents clearly demonstrate the extent of the damage, the cause of the damage, and the fact that it is covered under my policy.

### For Late Reporting Denial:
While the claim was reported on [date reported], which was [number] days after the incident, this delay was due to [legitimate reason for delay, e.g., inability to access property, not immediately aware of damage, etc.]. Section [policy section] of my policy states that notice should be given "as soon as practicable," which I did once I [discovered the damage/was able to access the property/etc.]. This delay did not prejudice your ability to investigate the claim, as the damage remained in the same condition.

1. Copy of my complete insurance policy
2. Photographs of the damage
3. Repair estimates from [contractor name(s)]
