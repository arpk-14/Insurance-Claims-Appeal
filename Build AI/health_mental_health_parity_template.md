Patient: [Patient Name]

Dear Claims Review Department:

I am writing to appeal your decision to deny coverage for mental health/substance use disorder treatment that was provided to me on [date of service] by [provider name]. According to your denial letter dated [denial date], the claim was denied because [specific reason from denial letter]. I believe this determination violates mental health parity laws and my policy benefits, and I am requesting a full review of this decision.

## Mental Health Parity Law Requirements

Under both federal and state law, health insurance plans must provide mental health and substance use disorder benefits that are comparable to medical and surgical benefits. Specifically:

1. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) prohibits insurers from imposing more restrictive limitations on mental health/substance use disorder benefits than on medical/surgical benefits.

2. This includes both quantitative limitations (such as visit limits, higher copays, or different deductibles) and non-quantitative treatment limitations (such as stricter medical necessity criteria, more rigorous prior authorization requirements, or more restrictive provider network standards).

## Treatment Background and Medical Necessity

I was diagnosed with [diagnosis] on [date of diagnosis] by [diagnosing physician/mental health professional]. The treatment in question, [treatment/service], was recommended by my provider, [provider name], who is a licensed [credentials] with expertise in treating this condition.

My provider determined this treatment was medically necessary based on:
1. My documented symptoms and condition
2. Standard clinical guidelines for treating my diagnosis
3. My treatment history and response to previous interventions
4. The risks of not receiving appropriate treatment

## Parity Violation Analysis

I believe the denial of my claim represents a potential parity violation for the following reasons:

1. **Comparable Medical/Surgical Coverage**: Your plan covers [comparable medical/surgical service] for physical health conditions, but has denied similar level of care for my mental health condition.

2. **Different Standards Applied**: The denial appears to apply more stringent medical necessity criteria to mental health services than would be applied to medical/surgical services.

3. **Network Adequacy Issues**: [If applicable] The lack of in-network providers with appropriate expertise forced me to seek out-of-network care, which should be covered at in-network rates when network inadequacy exists.

## Policy Coverage

My policy [policy number] specifically states that mental health and substance use disorder services are covered benefits. According to my policy documents, covered services include [quote relevant policy language]. The treatment I received falls within these covered services because:

1. It was provided by a licensed mental health professional
2. It was for a diagnosed mental health/substance use disorder
3. It was provided at an appropriate level of care for my condition
4. It meets the definition of medical necessity as defined in my policy

## Request for Review

Based on the information provided, I request that you reconsider your denial and approve coverage for this medically necessary mental health/substance use disorder treatment. If you require additional information to process this appeal, please contact me at [phone number] or [email address].

According to state law, federal regulations, and the terms of my policy, you are required to provide a determination of this appeal within [timeframe based on state law]. If my appeal is denied, please provide:

1. The specific reason for the denial
2. The specific plan provisions relied upon
3. A description of the medical necessity criteria used
4. An explanation of how these criteria are applied consistently between mental health and medical/surgical benefits
5. Information about my right to external review

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Patient Name]
