Patient: [Patient Name]

Dear Claims Review Department:

I am writing to appeal your decision to deny coverage for [treatment/procedure/service] that was provided to me on [date of service] by [provider name]. According to your denial letter dated [denial date], the claim was denied because the service was deemed "not medically necessary." After reviewing my policy benefits and consulting with my healthcare provider, I believe this determination was made in error, and I am requesting a full review of this decision.

## Medical Background and Necessity

I was diagnosed with [diagnosis] on [date of diagnosis] by [diagnosing physician]. My medical history related to this condition includes [brief relevant medical history]. Prior to the denied treatment, I had attempted the following treatments without adequate relief:

1. [Previous treatment 1] from [date] to [date], which resulted in [outcome]
2. [Previous treatment 2] from [date] to [date], which resulted in [outcome]
3. [Previous treatment 3] from [date] to [date], which resulted in [outcome]

My physician, [physician name], determined that [treatment/procedure/service] was medically necessary based on:

1. My documented medical history and condition
2. The failure of previous standard treatments to adequately address my condition
3. Current medical guidelines and standards of care for my diagnosis
4. The potential risks of delaying this treatment

## Supporting Medical Opinion

Enclosed is a letter from [physician name], who has been treating me for [time period]. Dr. [last name]'s letter explains in detail why this treatment was medically necessary and consistent with accepted standards of medical practice. As stated in the letter, this treatment was not elective or experimental, but rather an appropriate and necessary intervention for my specific medical condition.

## Policy Coverage

My policy [policy number] specifically states that medically necessary services are covered benefits. According to my policy documents, "medically necessary" is defined as [quote definition from policy]. The treatment I received meets this definition because:

1. It was ordered by a licensed physician for the treatment of a diagnosed medical condition
2. It was provided in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice
3. It was not primarily for convenience or comfort
4. It was the appropriate level of service for my condition

## Relevant Clinical Evidence

The medical necessity of [treatment/procedure/service] for patients with my condition is supported by:

1. [Clinical guideline/study 1]
2. [Clinical guideline/study 2]
3. [Professional medical association] recommendations

## Request for Review

Based on the information provided, I request that you reconsider your denial and approve coverage for this medically necessary [treatment/procedure/service]. If you require additional information to process this appeal, please contact me at [phone number] or [email address].

According to state law and federal regulations, you are required to provide a determination of this appeal within [timeframe based on state law]. If my appeal is denied, please provide a detailed explanation of the basis for the denial, including the specific policy provisions relied upon and the clinical rationale used in making the determination.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Patient Name]
