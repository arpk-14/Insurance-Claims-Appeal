Re: Appeal of Claim Denial Due to Pre-existing Condition
Policy Number: [Policy Number]
Claim Number: [Claim Number]
Date of Service: [Date of Service]
Patient: [Patient Name]

Dear Claims Review Department:

I am writing to appeal your decision to deny coverage for [treatment/procedure/service] that was provided on [date of service]. According to your denial letter dated [denial date], the claim was denied because the condition was determined to be pre-existing. After reviewing my medical history and policy provisions, I believe this determination was made in error, and I am requesting a full review of this decision.

## Policy Coverage and Pre-existing Condition Provisions

My health insurance policy [policy number] became effective on [policy effective date]. According to the policy documents, a pre-existing condition is defined as [quote definition from policy, typically a condition for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received within a specific period before the enrollment date].

The policy states that pre-existing conditions [are covered/are subject to a waiting period of X months/etc.] under the following circumstances: [quote relevant policy language regarding pre-existing conditions].

## Medical History and Condition Timeline

The condition for which I received treatment, [diagnosis/condition], was first diagnosed on [date of diagnosis], which was [before/after] my policy effective date. The relevant timeline of my medical history is as follows:

1. [Date]: [First relevant medical event, e.g., initial symptoms, first doctor visit, etc.]
2. [Date]: [Subsequent relevant medical events]
3. [Date]: [Policy effective date]
4. [Date]: [Diagnosis date, if after policy effective date]
5. [Date]: [Treatment date that was denied]

## Reasons Why Condition Should Not Be Considered Pre-existing

I believe my condition should not be considered pre-existing for the following reasons:

[Choose the most applicable reason(s)]

### No Prior Diagnosis or Treatment
Prior to my policy effective date, I did not receive any medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment for this condition. The first time I sought medical attention for symptoms related to this condition was on [date], which was [X days/months] after my policy became effective.

### New and Distinct Condition
While I have a history of [related condition], the current diagnosis of [current condition] is a new and distinct medical condition that was not present before my policy effective date. Medical records from Dr. [physician name] confirm that this is a separate condition that developed after my coverage began.

### Condition Within Continuity of Coverage
Prior to enrolling in this policy, I was continuously covered under [previous insurance company] from [start date] to [end date] with no gaps in coverage. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and/or state insurance regulations, this continuous coverage should protect me from pre-existing condition exclusions.

### Condition Developed After Waiting Period
My policy includes a [X-month] waiting period for pre-existing conditions, which ended on [date]. The treatment in question was provided on [date of service], which is after the waiting period expired. Therefore, even if the condition were considered pre-existing, it should now be covered under my policy.

## Supporting Documentation

I have enclosed the following documentation to support my appeal:

1. Copy of the denial letter
2. Complete medical records demonstrating the timeline of my condition
3. Letter from Dr. [physician name] confirming the date of diagnosis and/or explaining why this is not a pre-existing condition
4. [If applicable] Documentation of previous continuous insurance coverage
5. [Any additional relevant documentation]

## Request for Review
