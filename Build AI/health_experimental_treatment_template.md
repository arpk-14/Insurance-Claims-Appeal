Re: Appeal of Claim Denial
Policy Number: [Policy Number]
Claim Number: [Claim Number]
Date of Service/Loss: [Date of Incident]
Insured: [Policyholder Name]

Dear Claims Review Department:

I am writing to appeal your decision to deny coverage for my claim related to [brief description of treatment/service/damage] that occurred on [date of incident]. According to your denial letter dated [denial date], the claim was denied because the service/treatment was deemed "experimental or investigational." After reviewing my policy benefits and consulting with medical professionals, I believe this determination was made in error, and I am requesting a full review of this decision.

## Treatment Background and Standard of Care

I was diagnosed with [diagnosis] on [date of diagnosis] by [diagnosing physician]. The treatment in question, [treatment/procedure name], was recommended by my physician, [physician name], who is a [credentials/specialization] with [X] years of experience treating this condition.

This treatment is not experimental or investigational, but rather is:

1. Recognized as standard treatment by the medical community for my condition
2. Supported by peer-reviewed medical literature
3. Approved by [relevant regulatory body, e.g., FDA] for this specific use
4. Covered by other major insurance carriers for this condition

## Evidence of Medical Acceptance

The treatment/procedure in question meets the criteria for established medical practice as evidenced by:

1. **Medical Literature Support**: [Cite specific studies, journals, or medical guidelines]
2. **Professional Consensus**: [Reference relevant medical association positions or guidelines]
3. **Regulatory Approval**: [Reference FDA approval or other regulatory recognition]
4. **Insurance Industry Standards**: [Reference coverage by other major insurers if applicable]

## Policy Coverage Analysis

My policy [policy number] states that experimental or investigational treatments are defined as [quote definition from policy]. The treatment I received does not meet this definition because:

1. It has been subjected to clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy
2. It is recognized by professional medical organizations as standard treatment
3. It is not in a testing phase or limited to research settings
4. It has been in clinical use for [time period]

## Alternative Justification

Even if you maintain that this treatment has some experimental aspects, there are additional reasons it should be covered under my policy:

1. **Medical Necessity**: This was the only treatment option available after standard treatments failed, as documented in my medical records
2. **Cost Effectiveness**: This treatment is less expensive than the standard alternative of [alternative treatment]
3. **Precedent**: Your company has previously covered this treatment for patients with the same condition (if applicable)

## Supporting Documentation

I have enclosed the following documentation to support my appeal:

1. Letter from Dr. [physician name] explaining why this treatment is standard care, not experimental
2. Published medical studies demonstrating the efficacy of this treatment
3. Guidelines from [medical association] recommending this treatment
4. [Any additional relevant documentation]

## Request for Review

Based on the information provided, I request that you reconsider your denial and approve coverage for this medically necessary and non-experimental treatment. If you require additional information to process this appeal, please contact me at [phone number] or [email address].

According to state law and federal regulations, you are required to provide a determination of this appeal within [timeframe based on state law]. If my appeal is denied, please provide a detailed explanation of the basis for the denial, including the specific policy provisions relied upon and the clinical rationale used in making the determination.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Policyholder Name]

Enclosures:
